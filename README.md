# AnyCable Rails

AnyCable allows you to use any WebSocket server (written in any language) as a replacement for built-in Rails Action Cable server.

With AnyCable you can use channels, client-side JS, broadcasting - (almost) all that you can do with Action Cable.

You can even use Action Cable in development and not be afraid of [compatibility issues](#compatibility).

## Requirements

- Ruby >= 2.5
- Rails >= 5.0
- Redis (see [other options](https://github.com/anycable/anycable/issues/2) for broadcasting)

## How It Works

<img src="https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5781e0ed48e4679e302833d3/820x987/5b6a305417b04e20e75f49c5816e027c/Anycable_vs_ActionCable_copy.jpg" width="400" />

## Usage

Add `anycable-rails` gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "anycable-rails"

# when using Redis broadcast adapter
gem "redis", ">= 4.0"
```

(and don't forget to run `bundle install`).

### Interactive set up

After the gem was installed, you can run an interactive wizard to configure your Rails application for using with AnyCable by running a generator:

```sh
bin/rails g anycable:setup
```

### Manual set up

Specify AnyCable subscription adapter for Action Cable:

```yml
# config/cable.yml
development:
  adapter: any_cable # or anycable

production:
  adapter: any_cable
```

and specify AnyCable WebSocket server URL:

```ruby
# For development it's likely the localhost

# config/environments/development.rb
config.action_cable.url = "ws://localhost:3334/cable"

# For production it's likely to have a sub-domain and secure connection

# config/environments/production.rb
config.action_cable.url = "wss://ws.example.com/cable"
```

Then, run AnyCable RPC server:

```sh
$ bundle exec anycable

# don't forget to provide Rails env

$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec anycable
```

And, finally, run AnyCable WebSocket server, e.g. [anycable-go](https://docs.anycable.io/#/anycable-go/getting_started):

```sh
anycable-go --host=localhost --port=3334
```

See [documentation](https://docs.anycable.io/#/ruby/rails) for more information on AnyCable + Rails usage.
