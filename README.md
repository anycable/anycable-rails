# AnyCable Rails

AnyCable allows you to use any WebSocket server (written in any language) as a replacement for built-in Rails Action Cable server.

With AnyCable you can use channels, client-side JS, broadcasting - (almost) all that you can do with Action Cable.

You can even use ActionCable in development and not be afraid of compatibility issues.

[Example Application](https://github.com/anycable/anycable_demo)

For usage outside Rails see [AnyCable repository](https://github.com/anycable/anycable).

## Compatible WebSocket servers

- [Anycable Go](https://github.com/anycable/anycable-go)
- [ErlyCable](https://github.com/anycable/erlycable)


## Installation

Add Anycable to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'anycable-rails'

# or if you want to use built-in Action Cable server
# for test and development (which is possible and recommended)
gem 'anycable-rails', group: :production
```

**NOTE**: if you want to require `anycable-rails` _manually_ (i.e. with `require: false` in your `Gemfile`)
make sure that it's loaded prior to `Rails.application.initialize!` call (see `config/environment.rb`).

And then run:

```shell
rails generate anycable
```

to create executable.

## Configuration

Add `config/anycable.yml`if you want to override defaults (see below):

```yml
production:
  # gRPC server host
  rpc_host: "localhost:50051"
  # Redis URL (for broadcasting) 
  redis_url: "redis://localhost:6379/2"
  # Redis channel name
  redis_channel: "anycable"

```

Anycable uses [anyway_config](https://github.com/palkan/anyway_config), thus it is also possible to set configuration variables through `secrets.yml` or environment vars.

## Usage

Run Anycable RPC server:

```ruby
RAILS_ENV=production ./bin/anycable
```

and also run AnyCable-compatible WebSocket server, e.g. [anycable-go](https://github.com/anycable/anycable-go):

```sh
anycable-go --host=localhost --port=3334
```

Don't forget to set cable url in your environment:

```ruby
# For development it's likely the localhost

# config/environments/development.rb
config.action_cable.url = "ws://localhost:3334/cable"

# For production it's likely to have a sub-domain and secure connection

# config/environments/production.rb
config.action_cable.url = "wss://ws.example.com/cable"
```

### Logging

Anycable uses `Rails.logger` as `Anycable.logger` by default, thus Anycable _debug_ mode (`ANYCABLE_DEBUG=1`) is not available, you should configure Rails logger instead, e.g.:

```ruby
# in Rails configuration
if Anycable.config.debug
  config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  config.log_level = :debug
end
```

You can also turn on access logging (`Started <request data>` / `Finished <request data>`):

```ruby
# in anycable.yml
production:
  access_logs_disabled: false
```

## ActionCable Compatibility

This is the compatibility list for the AnyCable gem, not for AnyCable servers (which may not support some of the features yet).
